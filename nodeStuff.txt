Your Bedroom:\nYou just woke up, after a rough night. Your clock shows you that the time is 8:00 AM, and you have hardly two minutes to catch the bus.\nAlso, today is the last day of class, and Professor Rogers had told you last class that there might be a nice bonus today.\nYou're absolutely confused and you're not sure what you want to do. You still need to use the bathroom, or you could try to catch the bus.\nOr just go back to bed and sleep

Do you really want to go to class?\nYou still may be able to catch the bus.\nOr you could just go back to bed.\nThe weather looks nice. Maybe you could just go outside, and look at the sky.

Your bedroom (a while later):\nYou're back in the room. You go back to sleep, and this time you want it to be really long, so you play some hypnotic music as you try to sleep. Within no time you're out.\n...\n...\n...\n(a long time later)\nYou open your eyes, and everything around you looks really shiny and metallic. You hear some beeping in the distance. You look out the window, and you see a HUGE desert, with LANDSPEEDERS(?) racing on them.\nThe chip planted in your head while you were asleep by the FIRST ORDER tells you you're in the year 1590338 BC. Your location is the Tatooine.\nYou see a space-time teleportation machine (manufactured by MathWorks, creator of MATLAB) next to you, and the words "SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ME!" are written.

The path to your dorm:\nOh crap! You missed the bus. You see it leaving, and you're feeling bad.\nYou walk back towards your dorm, unsure of what to do next.\nYou could go back to bed, but you see a car parked by the dorm, and the keys seem to be in. There is no driver close by.\nMaybe you could "borrow" (steal) the car, and get there on time.\nThat's illegal though, maybe you could just run after the bus, on foot.
