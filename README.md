# GrandTechAuto

A game built in MATLAB (yes, such a thing exists). It's supposed to be one of those games
where you more or less have free will, and you live your life out until you hit one of 
many possible endings.  
  

You'll find a couple of unrelated files in this repo (mostly the map stuff). These are artifacts
from previous development stages of the game.  

  

Feel free to download and mess around.
